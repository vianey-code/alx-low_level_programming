# Singly linked lists

> Project done during `Full Stack Software Engineering studies` at `ALX AFRICA SE`. It aims to learn about linked lists in `C language`.

## Technologies

- C files are compiled using `gcc`
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04` LTS

## Private 📁
* [private](./private): This directory contains all my test files for this project.

### lists.h
- [lists.h](./lists.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

## Files 📃
> All of the following files are programs written in C:

_Filename_ | _Description_
-----------|----------------
[0-print_list.c](./0-print_list.c) | `function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.`
[1-list_len.c](./1-list_len.c) | `function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.`
[2-add_node.c](./2-add_node.c) | `function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.`
[3-add_node_end.c](./3-add_node_end.c) | `function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.`
[4-free_list.c](./4-free_list.c) | `function that frees a list_t list.`
[100-first.c](./100-first.c) | `function that prints a sentence before the main function is executed.`
[101-hello_holberton.asm](./101-hello_holberton.asm) | `64-bit program in assembly that prints "Hello, Holberton", followed by a new line.`
[README.md](./README.md) | `A README.md File`
