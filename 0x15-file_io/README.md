# File I/O

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at __ALX AFRICA SE School__. It aims to learn about how to handle files (open, close, read and write), file descriptors, system calls and file permissions in **C language**.

## Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
- C files are written according to the `C90 standard`.
- ested on Ubuntu `20.04 LTS`.

## test 📁
- [test](./test): This directory contains all my main.c and exe files for this project.

## Main.h
* [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

## Files 📃
* All of the following files are programs written in `C`


_Filename_ | _Description_ | _Prototype_
-----------|---------------|------------
[0-read_textfile.c](./0-read_textfile.c) | Reads a text file and prints it to the `POSIX` standard output | `ssize_t read_textfile(const char *filename, size_t letters)`
[1-create_file.c](./1-create_file.c) | a function that creates a file. | `int create_file(const char *filename, char *text_content)`
[2-append_text_to_file.c](./2-append_text_to_file.c) | a function that appends text at the end of a file. | `int append_text_to_file(const char *filename, char *text_content)`
[3-cp.c](./3-cp.c) | a program that copies the content of a file to another file. | **Usage:** cp file_from file_to
[100-elf_header.c](./100-elf_header.c) | a program that displays the information contained in the `ELF` header at the start of an ELF file. | **Usage:** elf_header elf_filename


## Tasks 🛅


0. **Tread lightly, she is near**

    - [0-read_textfile.c](./0-read_textfile.c): C function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.
    - The parameter letters is the number of letters the function should read and print.
    - If the file is `NULL` or cannot be opened or read - returns `0`.
    - If the `write` call fails or does not write the expected number of bytes - returns `0`.
    - Otherwise - returns the actual number of bytes the function can read and print.


1. **Under the snow**

   * [1-create_file.c](./1-create_file.c): C function that creates a file.
   * The paramter `filename` is the name of the file to create.
   * The parameter `text_content` is a null-terminated string to write to the file.
   * If `text_content` is `NULL`, the function creates an empty file.
   * The created file has the permissions `rw-------`.
   * If the file already exists, the existing permissions are not changed.
   * Existing files are truncated.
   * If `filename` is `NULL` or the funciton fails - returns `-1`.
   * Otherwise - returns `1` on success.


2. **Speak gently, she can hear**

   * [2-append_text_to_file.c](./2-append_text_to_file.c): C function that appends text at the end of a file.
   * The parameter `filename` is the name of the file.
   * The parameter `text_content` is a null-terminated string to append to the file.
   * The function does not create the file if it does not exist.
   * If `text_content` is `NULL`, nothing is added to the file.
   * If the function fails or `filename` is `NULL` - returns -1.
   * If the file does not exist or the user lacks write permissions on the file - returns `-1.`
   * Otherwise - returns `1`.


3. **cp**

   * [3-cp.c](./3-cp.c): C program that copies the contents of a file to another file.
   * Usage: `cp file_from file_to`
   * If `file_to` already exists, it is truncated.
   * The created file has the permissions `rw-rw-r--`.
   * If the file already exists, the existing permissions are not changed.
   * If the number of arguments is incorrect, the function prints Usage: `cp file_from file_to`, followed by a new line on the `POSIX` standard error and exits with code `97`.
   * If `file_from` does not exist or the user lacks read permissions on it, the function prints `Error: Can't read from file NAME_OF_THE_FILE`, followed by a new line and exits with code `98`.
   * Where `NAME_OF_THE_FILE` is the first argument passed to the program.
   * If files cannot be created or if write to `file_to` fails, the function prints Error: Can't write to `NAME_OF_THE_FILE`, followed by a new line and exits with code `99`.
   * Where `NAME_OF_THE_FILE` is the second argument passed to the program.
   * If the user cannot close a file descriptor, the function prints `Error: Can't close fd FD_VALUE`, followed by a new line on the `POSIX` standard error and exits with code `100`.
   * Where `FD_VALUE` is the value of the file descriptor.


4. **elf**

   * [100-elf_header.c](./100-elf_header.c): C program that displays the information contained in the `ELF` header at the start of an `ELF` file.
   * Usage `elf_header elf_filename`
   * Displayed information:
        - Magic
        - Class
        - Data
        - Version
        - OS/ABI
        - ABI Version
        - Type
        - Entry point address
   * Format is identical to `readelf -h` (version `2.26.1`).
   * If an error occurs or the file is not an `ELF` file, the function displays a corresponding error message to `stderr` and exits with a status value of `98`.
